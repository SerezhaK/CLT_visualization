# CLT_visualization
This project demonstrates the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** using a fully interactive pipeline:

- 🖌️ Draw an arbitrary probability distribution with your mouse
- 📊 Normalize it to represent a valid PDF (probability density function)
- 🧮 Estimate mathematical expectation and variance numerically and via Monte Carlo sampling
- 🎞️ Visualize how the distribution of sample means converges to a normal distribution
- 📈 Real-time animation showing both the source distribution and the evolving histogram of means
- 🧪 Optional: save the animation as `.mp4`

Perfect for educational purposes and statistical demonstrations! Made as part of education at the Central University
